# JPEG - Decoder

## How to run the program

- Navigate to the `/src` directory
- Run `g++ decoder.cxx`
- Run `a.exe ./pics/cat.jpg`

## Basic Overview of a JPEG encoder-decoder
Understanding a JPEG encoder. It consists of 4 major steps:

<details>
<summary>1. RGB â†’ YCbCr</summary>

- YCbCr color space separates luminance (Y) from chrominance (Cb and Cr), allowing for more efficient compression. Human vision is more sensitive to changes in brightness (luminance) than to changes in color (chrominance). By subsampling the chrominance channels (Cb and Cr), JPEG encoders can reduce the data needed to represent the image while preserving visual quality.


- The image is broken up into 8x8 blocks of pixels called MCUs (minimum coded units). Since we have 3 channels (Y, Cr, Cb), we will have 3 sets of MCUs. These MCUs can be treated as individual MCUs and further steps can be performed on them.

<details>
<summary>2. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)</summary>

- Converts image from spatial domain -> frequency domain
- low-frequency images? -> when pixels are very similar to their neighbors ; high-frequency images? -> when pixels are very different from their neighbors
- Human visual perception is less sensitive to changes in high-frequency information compared to low-frequency information
- The DCT tends to concentrate most of the image energy in a small number of low-frequency coefficients, while high-frequency coefficients represent finer details. Since the low-frequency coefficients contain a significant portion of the image's energy, they are less aggressively quantized during compression to preserve important image features and overall structure.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Quantization</summary>

- Reduces the precision of the frequency coefficients obtained after the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). By dividing the DCT coefficients by values in a quantization matrix, many of these coefficients become smaller and can be approximated to zero.
- Quantization is often designed to exploit properties of human visual perception. ie. high-frequency components -> larger quantization coefficients and lower will have smaller
- This is irreversible. eg: 23 and 5 => 23/5 = 4 => 4 * 5 = 20 (we lost precision data)
- These values decide how much your image is compressed.
  
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Huffman Coding</summary>

- more frequent coeffs -> smaller code length ; less frequent coeffs -> larger code length
- is stored in a zig-zag fashion because the lower triangle consists of the high-frequency components which are highly quantized and are often 0. These 0s can be grouped for efficient storage.

## Markers

### Start Of Image Marker (SOI)
- Every JPEG file starts with SOI marker.
```
FFD8    - SOI Marker (2B)
```

### End of Image Marker (EOI)
 - Every JPEG file ends with the EOI marker
```
FFD9    - EOI Marker (2B)
```

### Application Marker (APPN)
- Contains application-specific data eg. data of the encoding software (like photoshop etc.)
- These markers allow for extending the JPEG format to accommodate various types of metadata and application-specific data without affecting the image's visual representation.
- 16 such markers exist. 
```
FFE0 -> FFEF (16 Markers)

Marker Format:
FFEN LENGTH[2B] (Marker followed by 2B size in Bytes of Marker content)
LENGTH = length of marker content including the 2B for LENGTH.

```

### Define Quantization Table Marker (DQT)
- Specifies the quantization tables used for quantizing the frequency coefficients. JPEG allows for up to four quantization tables to be defined, though in practice, many JPEG images use only one or two tables. Each quantization table contains 64 entries, corresponding to the 64 frequency coefficients in an 8x8 block (MCU).
- The values aren't stored from left to right, top to bottom fashion. Instead, they are stored in zigzag fashion (we've defined a zigzag matrix for this translation) 
```
FFDB    - Marker (2B)
XXXX    - Length (2B)
Table Info       (1B)
Upper Nibble - 0/1 -> Tells if Quantization values are 8b or 16b values
Lower Nibble - Table ID (0, 1, 2, 3) [Luminance has a seperate quantization table than the chrominance channel so that's 2 (ID's 0 and 1), but this allows a max of 4]
[followed by either 64B or 128B based on the lower nibble of table info] - Table Values
```

### Start Of Frame Marker (SOF)
- The SOF marker is followed by parameters that describe various aspects of the image, such as its dimensions, color space, and component information.
- Sampling Factor: Refers to the ratio by which the image is downsampled in the horizontal and vertical dimensions for each color component during the compression process. (using for color and brightness in YCrCb) 
- There must always be a single SOF marker, and we must encounter it before the huffman bitstream
```
FFC0 -> FFCF (excludes C4, C8 and CC => 13 markers)

FFC0    - Baseline JPEG Marker (we are covering this one)
[When an image is said to be baseline it means that it contains only one huffman coded bit stream and that one bit stream contains info about all the MCU's in the JPEG]

FFCX    - Marker (2B)
XXXX    - Length (2B)
XX      - Precision [Tells u how many bits are used for the color channels and must always be 8 bit values ranging from 0 to 255] (1B)
XXXX    - Height (2B)
XXXX    - Width (2B)
[Height and Width must be non zero]
XX      - Number Of Components/Channels (is either 1 (grayscale jpeg) or 3(rgb)) (1B)

for each component:
XX      - Component ID (1B) [Must be either 1, 2 or 3]
XX      - Sampling Factor (1B)
XX      - Quantization Table ID (The one that is used on this component) (1B)
```

### Define Restart Interval Marker (DRI)
- The DC coefficient (which is essentially the first coefficient in an MCU (at position 0)) is dependent on the DC coefficient of the previous MCU (except the first MCU). What this essentially means is that, to calculate the actual DC coeff of say the second MCU, we add its value with the previous MCU's DC coefficient.
- AC coefficients (all other coeffs. from 1 to 63)
- DRI helps us define the interval of MCUs after which we add nothing to the current DC coeff (then proceed normally).
```
FFDD    - Marker (2B)
0004    - Length (2B)
XXXX    - Restart Interval (2B)
```

### Define Huffman Tables Marker (DHT)
- Specifies the Huffman coding tables used for encoding the DC and AC coefficients after quantization. Huffman coding is a lossless compression technique commonly used in JPEG compression to further compress the quantized coefficients obtained from the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
- Huffman Symbols (1B values): Upper Nibble: # of 0s preceeding current coeff. (0 -> 15); Lower Nibble: Length of current coeff. (bits (from 1 -> 10b only))
  => 16 * 10 = 160 symbols are possible (There are 2 special ones included: F0 -> skip 16 0s ; 00 -> stop(everything further is 0))
  => 162 symbols
- DC coeffs. are never preceeded by 0s (as they are the first symbol) => they get different huffman tables
  => upper nibble: always 0 ; lower nibble: 0 -> 11
  => 12 symbols
```
FFC4    - Marker (2B)
XXXX    - Length (2B)
Until Length is complete:
XX      - Table Info (1B)
[16]    - No of codes of each length (16B)
[X]     - Symbols (Sum of the prev 16)
```
Structure of the Table Info symbol (1B)
| Upper Nibble                                                        | Lower Nibble                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Boolean Value Either 0/1  0 - AC Huffman Table 1 - DC Huffman Table | Table ID   Values from 0-3 (Not shared between AC and DC tables) |


### Start of Scan Marker (SoS)
- scan: a Huffman-coded bitstream
- baseline JPEGs contain a single scan that contains every coefficient of every MCU.
```
FFDA    - Marker (2B)
XXXX    - Length (2B)
XX      - Number of Color Components (1B)

for each color-component:
XX      - Component ID (1B)
XX      - (upper nibble: dc huffman table id; lower nibble: ac huffman table id used on this color component) Table ID (1B)

XX      - Start of Selection (1B) [This value must be zero for Baseline JPEGs]
XX      - End of Selection (1B) [This value must be 63 for Baseline JPEGs]
XX      - Successive Approximation (1B) [Relevant w.r.t. Progressive JPEGs, must be 0]

---
This is followed by the Huffman Coded BitSteam
```

### Bit Map (BMP) Header [For the bmp output]
```
First Half Of The Header [14B]:
"BM"           - A start notation (2B)
size           - Header Size (4B)
00 00 00 00    - 4 unused bytes (4B)
00 00 00 1A    - Pixel Array Offset from start of the file (4B) [will always be the said num., because of the header options we're using]

Size Break-up = 
14 (first 1/2)
+ 12 (second 1/2)
+ H*W*3 (height * width * numOfColorChannels)
+ P * H (padding bytes * num of rows (ie. height)

Second Half Of The Header (DIB Header) [12B]:
12             - DIB Header Size (4B) [always 12]
width          - image width (2B)
height         - image height (2B)
1              - number of planes (2B) [must be 1]
24             - number of bits per pixel (2B) [8 (bits per color channel 0->255) * 3 (num of color components)]
```

## Huffman Coding (Algorithm)
- any valid code cant be the start of another valid code.
- Huffman coding tree (binary tree) => more frequent symbols are closer to the root and less frequent are farther.

### When we decode Huffman Codes for a JPEG we have: Symbols, Number of Codes of each length.
Algorithm:
1) Start with code candidate 0;
2) For each possible code length:
3) Append a 0 to the right of the code candidate;
4) For number of codes of this length:
4.1) Add current code candidate to list of codes and add 1 to the code candidate;
5) End;
